        <p>
            Hello! My name is Marcel Fiore.
            <br>I am a student at Colorado State University and planning to graduate in May, 2019 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.
            <br>I love programming and all the problem solving that comes with it.
            <br>I still have a lot of bases to cover, but so far I have enjoyed object oriented problem solving the most.
            <br>I also really like video games. Growing up, I carried a Gameboy everywhere I went and constantly played Pokemon.
            <br>
            <br>I plan to add more about me soon. I have a lot to add to this website and I work on it whenever I have free time.
        </p>
